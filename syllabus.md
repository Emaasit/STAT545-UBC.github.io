# Syllabus

A chronological diary of the course will evolve here. Something like [this from 2013](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/current.html) but hopefully more attractive!

Where marks will come from: The plan is to submit work once a week. The end result may still resemble a "final project", but one that has been built up gradually over the term. Expect some peer evaluation. No final exam.
